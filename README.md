# PythonConversor
This code was developed for my python development studies.  Its function is to convert an integer number that the user input, necessarily the number must be an integer, or it will give an error message.  This code was also structured to accept only the alternatives A, B or C, according to the instructions given by the program terminal (IDE).  The program is also structured for the user to give as calling instruction, two equal alternatives, otherwise the program displays an error message and terminates automatically.  This is my first back-end development.
